### Exploring Parallel Computing and Amdahl's Law



### **Task 1: Strong Scaling Test with OpenMP**
**Objective:** Perform a strong scaling test for a computational problem using Fortran and OpenMP.

1. Choose a simple computational task like solving the **1D heat diffusion equation**: A 1D rod of length $ L = 1.0 $with thermal diffusivity $\alpha = 0.01 $. Initial temperature distribution: $T(x, 0) = \sin(\pi x)$  representing an initial heat wave. Boundary conditions: $T(0, t) = 0, \quad T(L, t) = 0.$ Plot the results to make sure they make sense.
2. Run the program for a fixed problem size (e.g.,  $n = 10^6 $ with different numbers of threads (e.g., 1, 2, 4, 8, 16).
3. Record and plot the speedup vs. the number of threads.
4. Analyze the results in terms of Amdahlâ€™s Law:
   $$
   S_p = \frac{1}{(1 - f) + \frac{f}{p}},
   $$
   where \( f \) is the parallelizable fraction and \( p \) is the number of threads.

**Deliverables:** A plot of speedup vs. threads, with a discussion on where diminishing returns begin to appear.

### Task 2: Weak Scaling Test with MPI

**Objective:** Perform a weak scaling test for a distributed memory task using MPI.

1. Write a Fortan MPI program to implement a simple **domain decomposition** problem (e.g., splitting a 1D array and computing its sum or some more complicated artificial work).
2. Scale the problem size proportionally to the number of MPI processes (e.g., 1 process handles \( n = 10^6 \), 2 processes handle \( n = 2 \times 10^6 \), etc.).
3. Measure the runtime for different process counts (e.g., 1, 2, 4, 8) and verify that the runtime remains constant (ideal weak scaling).

**Deliverables:** A plot of runtime vs. number of processes, with a discussion on any deviations from ideal weak scaling.
